# PUZZLE
Golang CryptoCompare library

# Why?
If you are searching for a nice wrapper library that used CryptoCompare API this is the one. ☝️ 
I was not satisfied with how dynamic and unpredicted the API response was plus Go being a statically typed language wastes time configuring and normalizing data.

This library has a lot of struct's that extend the response, thus ensuring nice clean access to the data and providing easy way to add more functionalities with methods on the structs.

Currently I deliberatly don't add any interfaces and methods becouse I want you to use whatever methods fits best.
